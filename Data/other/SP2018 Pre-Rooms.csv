Power can be a tool of oppression when wielded in ways that create and maintain unequal social arrangements. Power can also be a tool for liberation when communities coordinate their efforts to transform their lived realities demanding and creating pathways towards just social arrangements. In this course, students will analyze, engage, and apply organizing strategies that promote justice-seeking communal change. Through sustain reflection on the strategies by which agents mobilize their power to transform their communities, independent reflection, planning and enacting social action events, students engage best practices to mobilize, create, and sustain power for community change. Instructor permission is required. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Topics to be addressed include the effects of nineteenth-century feminism on the visual arts, the role of women artists and critics in Victorian art institutions such as the Royal Academy, the representation of transgressive sexualities, gender and urban space, and the relationships between female literary characters and Victorian women.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been over a decade since the sequencing of the human genome was spelled out for the world. What followed was the birth of the post-genomic era of molecular biology. Instead of classifying diseases by a list of symptoms, scientists and doctors will be able to trace the causes of human disease to the very source: the gene. As a result, the face of modern medicine has been changed forever. All patients may soon be able to carry around a copy of their own DNA sequence in their back pocket. From that information, geneticists and doctors will be able to predict, diagnose, and treat disease with greater success than ever before. However, this information may also be a burden to those that bear it. Further, these technologies may allow modifications of patients’ genomes. In this course we will explore all of these issues and more as we learn that modern medicine and genetics are forever linked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Children whose development follows a trajectory that is different from the typical trajectory offer a unique opportunity to examine how these constraints operate. We will consider 3 broad categories of developmental disorders: 1) Genetic disorders (e.g., William's syndrome), 2) Behavioral deficits (e.g., developmental dyslexia), and 3) Disorders resulting from environmental factors (e.g., impoverished environments).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Likewise, 62.6 million individual Americans volunteered 7.8 billion hours of their time (Corporation for National and Community Service, 2017). This surge in donations and volunteerism begs the question, why do people give? In this course, students will seek answers to this question by focusing on the psychological antecedents of charitable giving.  Students (a) will meet weekly during  to discuss, critique, and build on relevant psychological literature, and (b) will spend a time each week working in the development or volunteerism offices of community partners. Working with their community partners, students will develop and implement a project that will aid community partners in fulfilling their fundraising- and volunteerism-related needs.
